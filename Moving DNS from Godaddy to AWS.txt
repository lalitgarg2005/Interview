1. Route53->Created HostedZone
2. Godaddy -> Rezoice.org -> Exported zone file
3. Import in route53 - error happened - used https://www.whatsmydns.net/ to get IP for rezoice.org
copied the value from Atlanta. 50.63.202.88
4. Pasted in line 39,40,41 - replaced the 'Parked' with this value.

Permanent (301)
Forward only
============

rezoice.com - 
ns29.domaincontrol.com
ns30.domaincontrol.com

config.php - changed the url to rezoice.com

===========
1. Have 3 domains. rezoice.com, rezoice.org, rezoice.in
2. There was an older hosting for rezoice.org and other 2 domains were forwarding to this.
3. I have taken a new hosting for rezoice.com
4. I have updated the DB and also uploaded the same files (which were backed up from rezoice.org)
5. I want all 3 domains should now point to the new hosting and want to delete the older hosting package.
