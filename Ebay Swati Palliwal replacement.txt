a* Given a set of points as an input and value for k, find the k closest points to the origin. The distance is the Euclidean distance
 * You can assume that there will always be k points that will satisfy the criteria
 * 
 * Eg 1:
 * Input= [[1,3],[-2,2]] , K=1
 * Output= [[-2,2]]


 Write a program that takes a sorted array as input and then modifies it to remove duplicates and shift the remaining elements to the left.
 * As the output it returns the number of valid elements in the array
 * Eg:1
 * Input = [2,3,4,4,8,8,8,11,11,11]
 * Modified input = [2,3,4,8,11,0,0,0,0,0]
 * Output = 5

Q: Given an array of integers, return an array of integers which contains
[1st integer, Sum of next 2 integers (2nd, 3rd), Sum of next 3 integers (4th, 5th, 6th)…]

Input size n

Output size m
[1,14,18,9]

private static List<Integer> summation(int[] arr){

}

For a given array return an array containing the even numbers first then the odd numbers. It should be done in-place, no other data structure is needed.
[3,2,1,4] ==> [2,4,3,1]

For a given string "abbbcddddeffabbbbbb" return the characters who are consecutively repeated like "bbb" and how many times it appears on the string.
For example, return a HashMap like,
b -> 2 Note: (bbb & bbbbbb)
d -> 1
f -> 1
Note: “a” appears two times but it is not consecutively repeated so it is not included. The same is true for “e”.

If you have list of “Person” object, sort them by their “Id”.
